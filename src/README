OpenCV python wrapper
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Provides a python interface to Intel's Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) library.
By default, the native CvMat and IplImage types are converted to PyNum arrays 
to provide compatibility with Scipy and other scientific libraries in python. 

Installation:
'make' to build
'make install' to install

Requirements:
SWIG  --  You'll need a fairly recent version in order expand the macros inside 
          some of the OpenCV structs ( CvSeq...etc ).  
		  Version 1.3.21 didn't work, but cvs as of 2005-03-23 did.  
OpenCV -- 0.9.6 and up
PyNum  -- Numerical Python 
SciPy  -- Some of the samples use scipy because at the moment I'm too lazy to 
          lookup the appropriate PyNum functions and imports
Notes:
I tried to make a distutils script for this, but distutils mysteriously switched 
some gcc flags around that caused the linker to ignore the opencv libraries.  
Very strange.

TODO:
-- figure out why some #defines are not being converted ... ie cvCvtPixToPlane
-- port samples from opencv directory to python as tests
-- figure out how to deal with pointers to pointers
-- add typemaps for CvScalar, CvSeq, etc.

rewrite shadow class -- 
use shape() 
use zeros()
short == 'h'
